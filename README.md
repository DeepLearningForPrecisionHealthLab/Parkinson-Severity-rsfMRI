## Files
### Subject cohorts
- `subject_lists.xlsx` contains the subject and session IDs from the [PPMI database](https://www.ppmi-info.org/) for the images included in our analysis.
### Model selection and hyperparameter optimization
- `updrstotal_prediction.py` is the main script for training and evaluating a set of models to predict MDS-UPDRS total score at a specified time, using a specified set of rs-fMRI inputs. Model hyperparameters are optimized using a random search, and model performance is evaluated using nested cross-validation. 
- `updrstotal_prediction_loso.py` performs a leave-one-site-out version of this analysis
### Measurment of test performance 
- After running these 2 scripts, `collect_results.py` and `collect_results_loso.py` identify the best performing models and hyperparameter configurations for
each target and feature type based on mean inner cross-validation performance. Evaluate these models on the held-out data of the outer cross-validation loop. 

## Additional resources
To further facilitate reproducibility, we have made some [additional files available here](https://cloud.biohpc.swmed.edu/index.php/s/LsiC2KetzJFNy8w). These include:
- Our derived ReHo and fALFF maps
- Docker image with our custom fMRI preprocessing pipeline
- Our modified [Schaefer 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28981612/) parcellation with subcortical ROIs and the anatomical ROI labels used in our figures. The BASC197 and BASC444 parcellations are available through nilearn.
